"Based"? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of 
that and your response to me is "Based"? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only word 
you can comprehend is "Based" - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with 
such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? 
Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my 
written work proof-read by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? I doubt you 
would, and your response to this will probably be "Based" once again. Do I give a fuck? No,
does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about five fucking letters? I bet you took 
the time to type those five letters too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself 
or 20 hearty seconds before pressing "send". You're so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly 
considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something 
like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by 
responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took 
longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? 
Absolutely nothing. I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a 
response. Do you want "Based" on your gravestone?
